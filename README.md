## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_. Backend part of the website is mostly done. For now, I only set it up to register a student into a class when scanned not some other categories. It already provide functions to generate QR code and logging people in. I planned to use Android as the client that consume the Rest API. Android skeleton project of student version has completed but it is completely hideous. Need some more work.
